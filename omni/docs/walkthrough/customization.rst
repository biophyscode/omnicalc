Customization
=============

Even though the authors have sought to make omnicalc as generic as possible, your particular use case will inevitably require a large degree of customization. The usefulness of our framework depends on these customizations, otherwise omnicalc would not be any more useful than the abundance of similar tools with larger user bases. 

Users who have read the documentation and have further questions about deployment are encouraged to submit a tickat at the `BioPhysCode project on github <http://github.com/biophyscode>`_, where you can also find contact information for the authors.
